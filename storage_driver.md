## **why `overlay2` is the default storage driver** in Docker on most modern Linux systems.

## 🔧 What Is `overlay2`?

`overlay2` is a **union file system** driver that stacks image layers together, combining them into a single mount view using the Linux **OverlayFS** kernel feature.

## ✅ Why `overlay2` Is the Default Driver

### 1. **Kernel Native Support**
- OverlayFS is built **into the Linux kernel** (since 3.18; stable from 4.0+).
- No need for external modules (unlike `aufs`).
- Faster, lighter, and more secure because it’s maintained upstream in the kernel.

### 2. **Simple & Fast Layer Management**
- `overlay2` is a **multi-layer** overlay, meaning it can handle many image layers **efficiently**.
- Previous `overlay` driver only allowed 2 layers (`lower` and `upper`), but `overlay2` supports **128+ layers** natively.

### 3. **Better Performance**
- Faster **container startup times**.
- Efficient **read** and **write** operations.
- Less CPU and I/O overhead compared to alternatives like `aufs` and `devicemapper`.

### 4. **Less Complex than AUFS**
- `aufs` is powerful but:
  - Requires out-of-tree kernel patches
  - Isn't supported in mainline kernel
  - Is more complex to maintain
- Docker deprecated `aufs` for most distributions

### 5. **Broad Compatibility**
- Works well across **most Linux distributions** (Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Debian)
- Docker uses it by default where kernel support is available

| Performance            | ✅ Fast        | ⚠️ Slower     | ⚠️ Slower        |
| Layer handling         | ✅ Multi-layer | ✅            | ❌ Thin provisioning |
| Simplicity             | ✅ Simple      | ❌ Complex    | ❌ Very complex   |
| Default in Docker      | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No         | ❌ No             |

### A diagram or example showing how layers are mounted in `overlay2`?

---
- A simple and clear **visual diagram** to explain how `overlay2` works under the hood and how Docker stacks image layers together.

## 🧱 **How `overlay2` Works – Visual Breakdown**

Let's say you have a Docker image with 3 layers:

1. `ubuntu:20.04` base image
2. Installed `nginx`
3. Custom config or app

When you run a container from that image, `overlay2` creates this structure:

```
/var/lib/docker/overlay2/
├── <layer1-id>    ← ubuntu:20.04
├── <layer2-id>    ← nginx installed
├── <layer3-id>    ← custom config
└── <container-id>/
    ├── diff/      ← Writable layer for the container
    ├── merged/    ← Mount point showing final unified view
    └── work/      ← OverlayFS work directory
```

---

## 🔍 **Layer Stack Overview**

```text
[Writable Layer]    ← diff/ (container writes here)
     │
[Layer 3]           ← custom configs or app files
     │
[Layer 2]           ← nginx installed
     │
[Layer 1]           ← ubuntu base layer
```

➡️ Docker mounts all these layers together into a **merged** directory.

So **inside the container**, it looks like a normal full Linux filesystem:

```text
/
├── bin/
├── etc/
├── usr/
└── var/
```

But in reality, it's stitched together from all those image layers.

---

## ✍️ Writing to a File in the Container

When your container modifies a file (say, `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`):

1. `overlay2` **copies the file** from the lower read-only layer to the top `diff/` layer
2. The container **modifies the copied file**
3. This is called **Copy-on-Write**

> 🔄 Reads always look through all layers from top to bottom; writes only affect the top layer.

## 🧠 Diagram (Text Art)

Here's a simplified ASCII diagram:

```
+--------------------+
|   Writable Layer   |  ← container writes here (diff/)
+--------------------+
|   Layer 3 (custom) |
+--------------------+
|   Layer 2 (nginx)  |
+--------------------+
|   Layer 1 (ubuntu) |
+--------------------+
        ↑
      merged/
(visible FS in container)
```
